# Inner δ-Approximation of the Convex Hull of Finite Sets

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithms proposed in our paper "*Inner δ-Approximation of the Convex Hull of Finite Sets*".
- The algorithms are implemented in innerCH.jl.
- The file main.jl provides an example of how to use our code and includes a comparison with the QHull library and other convex hull algorithms in the CGAL library.
- The file createData.jl generates the three types of random data used for computational experiments in our paper.
